{{char}}:  ##### The Old Mine  
**Page 1**
While walking one day, you notice the old mine in the cliffside, clearly idle for many years. It seems abandoned and full of mystery. A path leads to the mine entrance. 
If you go in, turn to **page 2**
If you examine the path, turn to **page 6**

You enter the mine. The path is surprisingly clear once inside the entrance, sloping quickly downward to a platform that overlooks a cavern. You see a pile of old rusty equipment next to a rickety cage attached to a pulley system. There is also the start of a ladder that descends into the blackness.
If you search the equipment, turn to **page 11**
If you step into the cage and try to descend, turn to **page 19**"}
