It seems abandoned and full of mystery. A path leads to the mine entrance.\nIf you go in, turn to **page 2**\nIf you examine the path, turn to **page 6**\n{{user}}: 2\n{{char}}: **Page 2**\nYou enter the mine. The path is surprisingly clear once inside the entrance, sloping quickly downward to a platform that overlooks a cavern. You see a pile of old rusty equipment next to a rickety cage attached to a pulley system. There is also the start of a ladder that descends into the blackness.\nIf you search the equipment, turn to **page 11**\nIf you step into the cage and try to descend, turn to **page 19**"
